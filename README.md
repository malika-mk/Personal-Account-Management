Project Overview
This project is a simple simulation of a banking system with functionalities to manage a personal account. It allows the user to:

Deposit funds into the account.
Withdraw funds from the account, checking if there are sufficient funds.
Track transactions (deposits and withdrawals) with detailed history.
The key class in my project is PersonalAccount, which handles the account's core functionality. It stores details such as the account number, account holder's name, balance, and a list of transactions.
